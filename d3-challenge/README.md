My name is Luan Castheloge and this repo is for D3-Challenge.



## 🚀 Quick start

  **Running the project**


  Get in the project folder
  ```sh
  cd d3-challenge/
  ```
  Install all dependencies
  ```sh
  yarn install
  ```
  Run the project
  ```sh
  yarn start
  ```
   
  **Why am I use React?**
  Because is an open source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces for single page applications.
    
  The big PRO to use a SPA is that our web application works (mostly) without reloading the web pages.
    
  React is very simple and easy to learn, basic javascript.

  It supports code reusability and give me more organization. It uses one side data binding and also flux which is an application architecture which controls the flow of the data from one point.

  I can use VirtualDOM that allows me create components of memory data structures, which computes the changes and then updates the browser. So a unique feature is enabled which allows the user to code and it renders the components, elements, and data which can ultimately be processed and used.
  
  **Why am I use Styled-components?**

  First of all, because sometime the main CSS file is "a casa da mãe joana".

  With styled-components we can to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles.
  
  Another thing is that styled-components generates unique class names for your styles. WE never have to worry about duplication.

  When I see that I'll work with Themes I thought and remembered of *createGlobalStyle*. So I adapting the styling of a component based on a **global theme** and puted dynamically.

  **Why am I use Gatsby?**
  
  When I read I realized that we don't have backend. I thought I'll use Gatsby, because is easier to start.

  But ok, why? First, velocity. I code and let Gatsby.js compile the most performant Webpack configuration to build my site. Additionally, it prefetches resources.

  Gatsby is based on React.js 

  I'm not an expert in GraphQL. Using Gatsby I start have contact with GraphQL.
  I only know that is a query language with which you can fetch data from nearly any source.

  Easy to take in production with Netlify.

    
  **Why am I use Netlify?**

  Because it's very simple to integrate with Gatsby and Github. And I already did once before.
